# Typeface: Noto Sans

Noto Sans is an unmodulated (“sans serif”) design for texts in the Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek scripts, which is also suitable as the complementary choice for other script-specific Noto Sans fonts. It has italic styles, multiple weights and widths, and 3,741 glyphs. Noto Sans is licensed under the Open Font License which allows us to use it in products & projects - print or digital, commercial or otherwise.

Noto Sans should be the primary font choice for all Cloudberry Database materials. You can download Noto Sans for free from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans).
